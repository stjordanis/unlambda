Preamble (Bible)
================

This document is what inspired me to learn about functional programming. Having played with Scheme a bit before, but not really understanding its true powers, I was fairly new to the entire concept. I didn't know what a lambda was, except for a vague notion of "anonymous functions", which, back then at least, seemed utterly useless to me.

But then came this document about a horrible programming language unlike any other brain-teaser I've seen before -- it showed simple concepts describing how to build a world around *abstract calculations*, rather than outright *action*. Where instead of the boring old "Hey, look, we passed Brainfuck commands through Huffmann coding and now it looks totally unreadable LOL SO RANDOM", I suddenly encountered a universe so different from everything I'd known thus far. And so, with the addition of this small preamble, I give you the bible, attached as "Unlambda Bible.html".

Usage
=====

Run unlambda.py for a REPL. Run tests.py to test if the environment is sane.
